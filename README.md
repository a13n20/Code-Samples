Sample scripts that I've done throughout my time in Chico

## C++

###Sorting Methods - CSCI 311

In this project, I had to create a script that would sort a random vector using four different methods, and record the runtime for each method based on the worst, best, and average cases. All code in Project_1.cpp is written by me.
