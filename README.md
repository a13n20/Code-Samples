Sample scripts that I've done throughout my time in Chico

## C++

### Sorting Methods - CSCI 311

In this project, I had to create a script that would sort a random vector using four different methods, and record the runtime for each method based on the worst, best, and average cases. All code in Project_1.cpp is written by me.

### Airport Simulation

This project was for creating a script simulating an airports landings and takeoffs, where one runway prioritized takeoffs and the other prioritized landings. Planes were sorted based on priority using heapsort. Airport Simulation is the full project details. All code files are written by me.
